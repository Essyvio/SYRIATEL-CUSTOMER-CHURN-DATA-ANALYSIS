# Project overview
This project employs machine learning algorithms to construct a model capable of accurately forecasting customer churn, leveraging data within the dataset. The dataset comprises 21 predictor variables, predominantly pertaining to customer usage patterns. The focal variable of interest is 'churn', which denotes whether a customer has churned or not. Given the categorical nature of the target variable, classification algorithms are employed to develop the predictive model. Recall serves as the metric for assessing the model's performance.This project analyzes SyriaTel data and builds models that predict whether a customer will churn or not.
