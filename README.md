# Project overview
This project employs machine learning algorithms to construct a model capable of accurately forecasting customer churn, leveraging data within the dataset. The dataset comprises 21 predictor variables, predominantly pertaining to customer usage patterns. The focal variable of interest is 'churn', which denotes whether a customer has churned or not. Given the categorical nature of the target variable, classification algorithms are employed to develop the predictive model. Recall serves as the metric for assessing the model's performance.This project analyzes SyriaTel data and builds models that predict whether a customer will churn or not.

# Business Understanding
The foundation of every business is its customers. They determine the value of products or services a business offers.Business depend on customers, failure to that no business exists hence businesses strive hard to get new customers as well as retained the existing ones.Understanding and managing customer churn is vital for the success of any business, as customers are the backbone of its operations and revenue generation. For SyriaTel, a telecommunications company facing a notable churn rate among its customer base, addressing this issue is critical for maintaining its market position and profitability.

By leveraging a predictive model, SyriaTel aims to forecast which customers are likely to terminate their services ("churn") in the near future. This predictive capability enables proactive measures to be taken, such as targeted retention strategies or personalized offers, to mitigate churn and preserve customer loyalty.
# Objectives:
- To find out the features thats are most important to our target variable

- To come up with a predictive model that predicts whether a customer will churn soon

- Come up with recommendations for customers predicted to churn.
  # Stakeholders
- SyriaTel company: A telecommunication company in Syria that is looking for help in increasing its profits by retaining its customers. That is, reducing the rate of customer churn. They are also in need of a model that predicts whether a customer (new or existing) will churn soon.

# Data Understanding:
The dataset obtained from Kaggle contains 3333 entries and 21 columns, including information about the state, account length, area code, phone number, international plan, voice mail plan, number of voice mail messages, total day minutes, total day calls, total day charge, total evening minutes, total evening calls, total evening charge, total night minutes, total night calls, total night charge, total international minutes, total international calls, total international charge, customer service calls and churn.
# Problem statement
This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is whether a customer churns or not.SyriaTel is facing an increasing churn rate,resulting to a comprehensive analysis to highlight the factors contributing to the customer attrition.The business context is focused on reducing losses incurred due to customer churn. By accurately identifying customers at risk of leaving, SyriaTel can implement targeted retention strategies to minimize churn and maximize customer lifetime value.The key question driving this project is whether there are predictable patterns in customer behavior that signal an increased likelihood of churn. By leveraging historical data on customer interactions, demographics, usage patterns, and churn status, the goal is to build a model that can effectively distinguish between customers who are likely to churn and those who are not.
# Data Preparation
The analysis  performed on the datasetincluded the following steps;Data cleaning, The dataset was checked per column to find the missing values,there were no duplicates & the outliers were handled accordingly using box plots.
